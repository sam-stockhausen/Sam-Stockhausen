Hi, I’m Samuel Stockhausen

I’m a cybersecurity graduate with a strong focus on SOC operations, detection engineering, and defensive security. I build hands-on labs to simulate real world attacks, generate telemetry, and detect them using SIEM and network security tools.

I’m actively pursuing entry level to junior roles in cybersecurity, SOC analysis, cloud security, and infrastructure security.

Areas of Focus

• Security Operations and Monitoring
• SIEM Deployment and Alerting
• Incident Response and Log Analysis
• Network Security and Firewalls
• Windows Active Directory Environments
• Cloud and Hybrid Security Labs

Tools and Technologies

pfSense
Windows Server 2022 and Active Directory
Wazuh and Security Onion
Suricata and Snort
Kali Linux
Ubuntu Linux
Wireshark and tcpdump
Nessus and OpenVAS
AWS VPC and hybrid networking

Featured Projects

• Wazuh SIEM with simulated attack detection
• pfSense firewall and segmented homelab network
• Active Directory attack and detection lab
• Data exfiltration and command and control simulation
• MITM and plaintext traffic analysis lab

Each project includes architecture diagrams, setup steps, attack simulation, detection evidence, and lessons learned.
